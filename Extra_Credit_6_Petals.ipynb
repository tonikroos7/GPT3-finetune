With Petals, you can join compute resources with other people over the Internet and run large language models such as 176B-parameter [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) or [BLOOMZ](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz), which are of the same size as GPT-3.\n",

Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities.
